		<h3>Personal Background:</h3> 
		<p>I was born in Texas, but I've lived most of my life in North Carolina. I love animals and have a few pets of my own! A dog, a cat, and a couple of fish - Nicholas, Marie, and Michi; Kubo; Veni; Vidi; and Vici (respectively).
		</p>
	
		<h3>Professional Background:</h3>
		<p>I went from working to be an event planner, to learning how to be a dog groomer, to finally settling on going back to school. My professional background is widely variably to say politely.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Academic Background:</h3>
		<p>I have been in and out of college since 2013. I actually started out at CPCC for get my basics done before going to UNCG for their Community Therapeutic Recreations and Event Planning program. They basically said the only thing that will get you into the field you were in school for was to volunteer and hope by year two that they'd hire you on for part time. I decided after my first semester there that I was just wasting money. Came back to Charlotte, tried to get into catering/event design for a bit, and then I sat down and really thought about what I want my future to look like.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Primary Computer Platform:</h3>
		<p>I operate on Windows. I do want to try out Linux more, but I'll get there when I get there.
		</p>
	
		<h3>Courses I'm Taking, and Why:</h3>
		
				<ul>
					<li>CIS115: Intro to Prog & Logic - This class about Python so I thought it would be beneficial to have somewhere to start with that.</li>
					
					<li>DBA110: Database Concepts - Since I've recently decided that I want to start aiming to become a Full Stack Web Developer, I thought this class would be a good stepping stone.</li>
					
					<li>DBA120: Database Programming I - This is the next step for me since I figured that I would be working with a lot of databases.</li>
					
					<li>WEB110: Internet/Web Fundamentals - I wanted to take this class to better understand HTML and CSS. Here is a link back to my <a href="contract.html">Course Contract.</a></li>
					
				</ul>	
	
		<h3>Something to Remember Me By:</h3> 
		<p>I have a mohawk that I started growing during quarantine and I can recommend a specific dog breed for your lifestyle if you ask.
