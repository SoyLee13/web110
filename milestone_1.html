		<p><b>What is the purpose of the site? What do you want the web site to accomplish? What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?</b>
		<br />
			The purpose of this sight is to set up a webpage for one of my favorite local food trucks. They do not have their own website, but they do use Square, 
			so I think it would be beneficial for them to eventually have a site where they can reach more people.
		</p>	
		<p><b>Who is your intended audience? Be specific.</b>
		<br />
			The website is intended for me...mostly. Jokes aside, it's meant for people around the Indian Trail and Matthews area, and foodies who love food trucks.
		</p>
		<p><b>	What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific.</b>
		<br />	
			The content on my site will feature a menu, an 'about us' page (which will most likely have filler text), contact info; which will utilize a form, and a home page that will list hours and location.
		</p>
		<p><b>	List at least two related or similar sites found on the Web.</b>
