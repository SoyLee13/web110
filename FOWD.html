    <h1>Focus On Web Design Assignment:
        <br />
    <a  href="https://us.shein.com/" >"Shein"</a></h1>

    <h2>What is the purpose of the site?</h2>
            <p>To market and sell products overseas.</p>
    
    <h2>Who is the intended audience?</h2>
            <p>The target audience is mostly toward women in their 20s, 30s, and, most likely, 40s as well. </p>
    
    <h2>Do you believe the site reaches its audience?</h2>
            <p>It looks like they reach their intended markets pretty well. They've been online since 2008, and from what I remember of them then, they have grown a lot.</p>
    
    <h2>Was this site useful to you? Why or why not?</h2>
            <p>Yes, I would say that it's pretty useful to me. Mostly because I like online shopping and they offer a lot more then just clothes. It also helps that they have good prices.</p>
    
    <h2>List the colors and/or graphics that are used on the home page of this website: background, backgrounds of page sections, text, logo, navigation buttons, and so on.</h2>
            <p>So the background is all white, but it looks like it's going for more of a modern style. All their images are linked to take you to the deals they are offering. There is a border at the very top advertising their specials. They also have a floating nav plane. I will say, that despite the fact that their going for a more of a modern style, it doesn't quite have the same impact due to the lack of use of white space. As I resize my browser, it seems that menu navigation could use style changes.</p>
    
    <h2>How does the use of color and graphics enhance the website?</h2>
            <p>The website has a lot going on, but I do think that works for them right now just because of the sheer amount of items they sale. Plus, it would stand to reason more people would use Shein's app for their phones. Although, I don't have it, so I'm not sure what their app looks like on my phone.</p>
