			<h2>My Hobby is...</h2>
			
			<h3>Cooking</h3>

				<p>I never really use to cook with my family. So, when I started to live on my own, I had to learn from scratch.
					At times, it was exhausting. Coming home from working 12 hour-shifts, I worked at and trying to cook.
					And if I didn't like the food? Too bad, so sad! Money went into that food so I had to eat it (within reason of course). 
					Those times were few and far in-between. I had fun learning different recipes and adding more and more to cooking skill set.
				</p>
				
			<h3>Baking</h3>

				<p>I'm not a huge sweets person. I tend not to make desserts too often and when I do it usually ends up being for practice. But breads!
					Now that's some baking I can do! I find it a really relaxing process. The thing I learned about it though is the fact that it's a very precise process.
					So a lot of little things can affect your baking. Even things you don't think about like altitude. I think that's why I also enjoy coding too.
					Here's a link for those who want to get start making sourdough, but don't know how:

			<h3>Everything in Between</h3>

				<p>When it comes down to it, I love cooking for other people, but not professionally.
					I love hosting Sunday dinners and I love it when people enjoy my cooking.
